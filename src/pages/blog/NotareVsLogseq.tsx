## 1. Knowledge Management: Visual Canvas vs. Outliner

### Notare: Infinite Visual Canvas
Notare’s **infinite canvas** lets you:
- **Drag and drop notes, PDFs, and images** anywhere.
- **Connect ideas with edges** to show relationships.
- **Zoom in/out** to see the big picture or dive into details.

*Example:* A researcher can **map an entire literature review** on one canvas, linking papers by themes or arguments.

![Notare Canvas Example](https://notare.uk/images/notare-canvas-example.png)

### Logseq: Outliner + Graph View
Logseq is built around an **outliner** (like Workflowy) with a **graph view** for connections:
- **Hierarchical notes** (nested bullet points).
- **Graph view** shows links between notes (like Obsidian).
- **Plugins** add features like Kanban boards or PDF annotation.

*Example:* You can **nest notes deeply** but may struggle to visualize complex relationships.

**Winner:** **Notare** for visual, spatial knowledge mapping.

## 2. AI Capabilities: Built-In vs. Plugin-Dependent

### Notare: AI-Powered from Day One
Notare’s AI helps you:
- **Summarize PDFs** in one click.
- **Extract key insights** from research papers.
- **Chat with your notes** to ask questions or clarify ideas.

*Example:* Upload a 50-page paper, and Notare will **generate a 1-page summary** with key points.

### Logseq: AI via Plugins
Logseq **doesn’t include AI natively**. You’ll need plugins like:
- **Logseq Copilot** (for AI writing).
- **Readwise** (for importing highlights).

*Example:* To summarize a PDF, you’d need to **manually copy-paste text into a plugin**—no direct integration.

**Winner:** **Notare** for seamless AI integration.

## 3. PDF Integration: Upload and Summarize vs. Manual Work

### Notare: Upload and Summarize
- **Drag and drop PDFs** directly into your canvas.
- **AI summarizes the PDF** and extracts key points.
- **Link quotes or ideas** to your visual map.

*Example:* A researcher can **upload 10 papers**, let Notare summarize them, and then **build a connected map of arguments**.

### Logseq: Manual Work Required
- **No native PDF support**. You must:
  1. Extract text from PDFs manually (e.g., using a third-party tool).
  2. Paste the text into Logseq.
  3. Manually link notes.

*Example:* Summarizing a PDF in Logseq requires **3+ tools and manual effort**.

**Winner:** **Notare** for effortless PDF handling.

## 4. Collaboration: Shared Canvases vs. Local Files

### Notare: Built for Teams
- **Share canvases** with collaborators (e.g., supervisors, classmates).
- **Real-time editing** (coming soon).
- **Export as Markdown** to avoid lock-in.

*Example:* A research team can **collaborate on a shared literature review map**.

### Logseq: Local-First Philosophy
- **No built-in collaboration**. Options include:
  - **Syncing files** via Git or Dropbox (complex setup).
  - **Logseq Sync** (paid, experimental).

*Example:* Collaborating in Logseq requires **technical setup** and manual file management.

**Winner:** **Notare** for seamless collaboration.

## 5. Data Ownership: Export vs. Local Files

### Notare: Export Anytime
- **Export canvases as Markdown** to use in other tools (e.g., Logseq, Obsidian).
- **No vendor lock-in**—your data is yours.

### Logseq: Local Files by Default
- **Your notes are stored locally** (no cloud dependency).
- **Plugins can sync to cloud services** (e.g., GitHub, Dropbox).

**Winner:** **Tie**—both prioritize data ownership.

## 6. Pricing: Free Tier vs. Self-Hosted

### Notare: Transparent Pricing
| Plan          | Price  | AI Credits | Canvases | PDF Uploads |
|---------------|--------|------------|----------|-------------|
| Free          | £0     | 50         | 3        | 5           |
| Personal      | £8/mo  | 200        | Unlimited| 20          |
| Professional  | £20/mo | 1,000      | Unlimited| Unlimited   |

### Logseq: Free and Open-Source
- **Core app is free and open-source**.
- **Self-hosted** (no subscription fees).
- **Plugins may cost** (e.g., Logseq Copilot for AI features).

**Winner:** **Logseq** for cost (free), but **Notare** for predictability and AI features.
